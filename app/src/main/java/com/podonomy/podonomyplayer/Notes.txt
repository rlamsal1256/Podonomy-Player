EventBus
=========
- We currently use EventBus from greenbot, but I think that we will have to write our own  at a later point.
  EventBus has some drawback.
    1- it does not preserver the priority across threads.  For instance, I setup the EventLogger's priority
       to be very high so it would get invoked first before anyone else.  this way the event woudl be record
       for sure in the logs prior to the event being received by other threads.  EventBus does not preserver
       priority across threads, just within thread resulting in the EventLogger being called after the event
       began its processing.
    2- A real message bus allows for the receiver to know who sent the message and then send the response back
       to it.  EventBus doesn't support that.  An event is posted and the subscribers to that event receive
       the event but the subscribers have no way to "reply" to the poster.  The EventBus acts as a broadcast
       network.
- I think Android needs something closer to a real message bus like java JMS but running locally.  No need to
  run over a separate process and communicate to a url/port, but having more of the JMS features would be nice.
  For instance:
    - publish / subscribe mechanism
    - brodcast messaging.
    - persistent message (with being able to specify TTL)
    - 1 to 1 communication
    - ability to specify channels and publish/subscribe to a channel.


Todo:
======
- When a user unsubscribed from a channel, a popup (yes/no) asking him to confirm should appear so the user can
  confirm whether he really wishes to unsubscribed from this channel or not.
- Subscription Activity:
    - The search results don't seem to be saved properly.  after a search, I go home and the launch the app
      again and the results tab is empty.  It should show the last search results.
- Channel Details:
    - The episode description in the listview should be a webview and not a textview as currently.
      Channels with an html description don't show up nicely.
    - After clicking the down arrow to download an episode, the arrow should become grayed out.  The play
      button should also be grayed out until the episode is downloaded.
    - The context menu is empty.  it shouldn't be.
    - Upon arriving on the channel details page and when the list of episodes is being fetched from the internet,
      a waiting circle should appear.
- We need a Download Queue activity showing the episodes being downloaded and their status.  I will wireframe.
